        <h2>National Education Policy 2020</h2>
        <p >The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is a comprehensive framework for education in India, which was announced by the Ministry of Education in July 2020. The NEP aims to provide a holistic, student-centered, and flexible education system that prepares students for the challenges of the 21st century. The policy focuses on developing critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills among students, and also emphasizes the use of technology and digital tools in education.</p>

         <p> One of the key highlights of the NEP 2020 is the emphasis on vocational education. The policy recognizes that vocational education is critical for the economic growth of the country and for providing employment opportunities to young people. The NEP proposes the integration of vocational education into the mainstream education system, starting from the secondary level. It also emphasizes the need for skill development and the provision of internships and apprenticeships to students to enhance their employability.
          </p>
          <p>Every student will take a fun course,
            during class 6-8, that gives a survey and
            hands-on experience of a sampling of
            important vocational crafts, such as
            carpentry, electric work, metal work,
            gardening, pottery making, etc., as
            decided by States and local communities
            and as mapped by local skilling needs.</p>
            <h2>Pre Vocational Class 6-8</h2>
            <p><a href="activities.html">Bagless Days</a> is a term used in the Indian education system to refer to days when students are not required to carry school bags. The National Education Policy 2020 has introduced the concept of "pre-vocational education" as a part of the school curriculum to be taught to students from class 6 to 8. This education will be imparted through a variety of practical experiences such as art, music, sports, storytelling, and vocational skills.</p>

              <p>One of the key initiatives under pre-vocational education is the introduction of "10 bagless days" in schools across India. These days are aimed at providing students with an opportunity to engage in experiential learning activities that do not require textbooks or conventional classroom teaching. The activities may include gardening, pottery, cooking, art, and craft, among others.</p>

        <h2>Class 9-10</h2>
        <p>Under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, vocational education is proposed to be integrated into the mainstream education system starting from the secondary level. For classes 9 and 10, the NEP recommends offering vocational courses as elective subjects. These courses will be designed to provide practical knowledge and skills related to various professions, trades, and industries.</p>
         <p> The vocational courses will be based on the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), which is a competency-based framework that organizes qualifications according to the knowledge, skills, and aptitude required for a particular occupation. The NSQF has been developed by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and is recognized by various industries and sectors.</p>
          <p>The vocational courses will be designed to provide students with hands-on experience in various trades and professions, which will help them develop a practical understanding of the working world. These courses will also help students gain employable skills, which will be useful for them in their future careers.</p>

        <h2>Class 11-12</h2>
        <p>Under the National Education Policy 2020, vocational education will be further strengthened for classes 11 and 12. Students who choose vocational education as an option will be given the opportunity to pursue internships or work-based learning, which will help them develop practical skills and knowledge relevant to the industry. They will also be provided with the opportunity to earn credits towards their degree or diploma courses..</p>
         <p> Furthermore, NEP 2020 aims to establish vocational education as a viable alternative to mainstream academic courses by providing students with the necessary skills and competencies to succeed in their chosen vocations.</p>
